<p align="center">
  A data analysis project exploring survival patterns on the Titanic using Python and Seaborn.
</p>

---

## 📊 Overview

This project explores the famous **Titanic** dataset  focusing on:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Summary statistics and group-based insights  
- Visualizing survival patterns across gender, class, and age  

---

- **Features used**:
  - `Survived`, `Pclass`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Fare`, `Embarked`, `Who`, `Deck`, etc.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

- Handled missing values:
  - `Age`: Filled with median  
  - `Embarked`: Filled with mode  
  - `Deck`: Dropped due to large number of missing values
- Converted data types and created new categorical columns (like `Who`, `Alone`)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- 💡 **Females had a much higher survival rate** compared to males.
- 🎩 **First-class passengers had the highest chance of survival**.
- 🧒 **Children and young adults** had better survival odds than older passengers.
- ⚰️ **Male passengers in third class** had the lowest survival rate.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- Distribution of survival by **gender**, **age**, and **passenger class**  
- Heatmaps and count plots using **Seaborn** for correlation and comparisons
